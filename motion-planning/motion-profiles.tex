\chapter{Motion profiles}

If smooth, predictable motion of a \gls{system} over time is desired, it's best
to only change a \gls{system}'s \gls{reference} as fast as the \gls{system} is
able to physically move. Motion profiles, also known as trajectories, are used
for this purpose. For multi-state \glspl{system}, each \gls{state} is given its
own trajectory. Since these \glspl{state} are usually position and velocity,
they share different derivatives of the same profile.

\section{1-DOF motion profiles}
\label{sec:1_dof_motion_profiles}
\index{motion profiles!1-DOF}

Trapezoid profiles (figure \ref{fig:trapezoid_profile}) and S-curve profiles
(figure \ref{fig:s-curve_profile}) are the most commonly used motion profiles in
FRC for point-to-point movements with one degree of freedom ($1$ DOF). These
profiles accelerate the \gls{system} to a maximum velocity from rest, then
decelerate it later such that the final acceleration velocity, are zero at the
moment the \gls{system} arrives at the desired location.

These profiles are given their names based on the shape of their velocity
trajectory. The trapezoid profile has a velocity trajectory shaped like a
trapezoid and the S-curve profile has a velocity trajectory shaped like an
S-curve.

\index{motion profiles!S-curve}
In the context of a point-to-point move, a full S-curve consists of seven
distinct phases of motion. Phase I starts moving the \gls{system} from rest at a
linearly increasing acceleration until it reaches the maximum acceleration. In
phase II, the profile accelerates at this maximum acceleration rate until it
must start decreasing as it approaches the maximum velocity. This occurs in
phase III when the acceleration linearly decreases until it reaches zero. In
phase IV, the velocity is constant until deceleration begins, at which point the
profiles decelerates in a manner symmetric to phases I, II and III.

\index{motion profiles!trapezoid}
A trapezoid profile, on the other hand, has three phases. It is a subset of an
S-curve profile, having only the phases corresponding to phase II of the S-curve
profile (constant acceleration), phase IV (constant velocity), and phase VI
(constant deceleration). This reduced number of phases underscores the
difference between these two profiles: the S-curve profile has extra motion
phases which transition between periods of acceleration and periods of
nonacceleration; the trapezoid profile has instantaneous transitions between
these phases. This can be seen in the acceleration graphs of the corresponding
velocity profiles for these two profile types.

\subsection{Jerk}

The motion characteristic that defines the change in acceleration, or
transitional period, is known as ``jerk". Jerk is defined as the rate of change
of acceleration with time. In a trapezoid profile, the jerk (change in
acceleration) is infinite at the phase transitions, while in the S-curve profile
the jerk is a constant value, spreading the change in acceleration over a period
of time.

From figures \ref{fig:trapezoid_profile} and \ref{fig:s-curve_profile}, we can
see S-curve profiles are smoother than trapezoid profiles. Why, however, do the
S-curve profile result in less load oscillation? For a given load, the higher
the jerk, the greater the amount of unwanted vibration energy will be generated,
and the broader the frequency spectrum of the vibration's energy will be.

This means that more rapid changes in acceleration induce more powerful
vibrations, and more vibrational modes will be excited. Because vibrational
energy is absorbed in the system mechanics, it may cause an increase in
\gls{settling time} or reduced accuracy if the vibration frequency matches
resonances in the mechanical system.

\subsection{Profile selection}

Since trapezoid profiles spend their time at full acceleration or full
deceleration, they are, from the standpoint of profile execution, faster than
S-curve profiles. However, if this ``all on"/``all off" approach causes an
increase in settling time, the advantage is lost. Often, only a small amount of
``S" (transition between acceleration and no acceleration) can substantially
reduce induced vibration. Therefore to optimize throughput, the S-curve profile
must be tuned for each a given load and given desired transfer speed.

What S-curve form is right for a given \gls{system}? On an application by
application basis, the specific choice of the form of the S-curve will depend on
the mechanical nature of the \gls{system} and the desired performance
specifications. For example, in medical applications which involve liquid
transfers that should not be jostled, it would be appropriate to choose a
profile with no phase II and VI segment at all. Instead the acceleration
transitions would be spread out as far as possible, thereby maximizing
smoothness.

In other applications involving high speed pick and place, overall transfer
speed is most important, so a good choice might be an S-curve with transition
phases (phases I, III, V, and VII) that are five to fifteen percent of phase II
and VI. In this case, the S-curve profile will add a small amount of time to the
overall transfer time. However, the reduced load oscillation at the end of the
move considerably decreases the total effective transfer time. Trial and error
using a motion measurement system is generally the best way to determine the
right amount of ``S" because modeling high frequency dynamics is difficult to
do accurately.

Another consideration is whether that ``S" segment will actually lead to
smoother control of the \gls{system}. If the high frequency dynamics at play are
negligible, one can use the simpler trapezoid profile.
\begin{remark}
  S-curve profiles are unnecesary for FRC mechanisms. Motors in FRC effectively
  have first-order velocity dynamics because the inductance effects are on the
  order of microseconds; FRC dynamics operate on the order of milliseconds.
  First-order motor models can achieve the instantaneous acceleration changes of
  trapezoid profiles because voltage is electromotive force, which is analogous
  to acceleration. That is, we can instantaneously achieve any desired
  acceleration with a finite voltage, and we can follow any trapezoid profile
  perfectly with only feedforward control.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Profile equations}

\subsubsection{Trapezoid profile}

The trapezoid profile uses the following equations.
\begin{align*}
  x(t) &= x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \\
  v(t) &= v_0 + at
\end{align*}

where $x(t)$ is the position at time $t$, $x_0$ is the initial position, $v_0$
is the initial velocity, and $a$ is the acceleration at time $t$.

Snippet \ref{lst:trapezoid_profile} shows a Python implementation.

  \label{lst:trapezoid_profile}
\end{coderemote}

\subsubsection{S-curve profile}

The S-curve profile equations also include jerk.
\begin{align*}
  x(t) &= x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 + \frac{1}{6}jt^3 \\
  v(t) &= v_0 + at + \frac{1}{2}jt^2 \\
  a(t) &= a_0 + jt
\end{align*}

where $j$ is the jerk at time $t$, $a(t)$ is the acceleration at time $t$, and
$a_0$ is the initial acceleration.

\end{coderemote}

\subsection{Other profile types}

The ultimate goal of any profile is to match the profile's motion
characteristics to the desired application. Trapezoid and S-curve profiles work
well when the \gls{system}'s torque response curve is fairly flat. In other
words, when the output torque does not vary that much over the range of
velocities the \gls{system} will be experiencing. This is true for most servo
motor systems, whether DC brushed or DC brushless.

Step motors, however, do not have flat torque/speed curves. Torque output is
nonlinear, sometimes has a large drop at a location called the ``mid-range
instability", and generally drops off at higher velocities.

Mid-range instability occurs at the step frequency when the motor's natural
resonance frequency matches the current step rate. To address mid-range
instability, the most common technique is to use a nonzero starting velocity.
This means that the profile instantly ``jumps" to a programmed velocity upon
initial acceleration, and while decelerating. While crude, this technique
sometimes provides better results than a smooth ramp for zero, particularly for
\glspl{system} that do not use a microstepping drive technique.

To address torque drop-off at higher velocities, a parabolic profile can be
used. The corresponding acceleration curve has the smallest acceleration when
the velocity is highest. This is a good match for stepper motors because there
is less torque available at higher speeds. However, notice that starting and
ending accelerations are very high, and there is no ``S" phase where the
acceleration smoothly transitions to zero. If load oscillation is a problem,
parabolic profiles may not work as well as an S-curve despite the fact that a
standard S-curve profile is not optimized for a stepper motor from the
standpoint of the torque/speed curve.

\section{2-DOF motion profiles}
\index{motion profiles!2-DOF}

In FRC, point-to-point movements with two degrees of freedom ($2$ DOFs) are
almost always within the context of drivetrains where the two degrees of freedom
are the $x$ and $y$ axes.

A \textit{path} is a set of (x, y) points for the drivetrain to follow. A
drivetrain \textit{trajectory} is a path that includes both the states (e.g.,
position and velocity) and control inputs (e.g., voltage) of the drivetrain as
functions of time.

Currently, the most common form of multidimensional trajectory planning in FRC
is based on polynomial splines. The splines determine the path of the
trajectory, and the path is parameterized by a trapezoidal motion profile to
create a trajectory. \textit{A Dive into WPILib Trajectories} by Declan
Freeman-Gleason introduces 2-DOF trajectory planning in FRC using polynomial
splines \cite{bib:a_dive_into_wpilib_trajectories}.

\textit{Planning Motion Trajectories for Mobile Robots Using Splines} by
Christoph Sprunk provides a more general treatment of spline-based trajectory
generation \cite{bib:spline_traj_sprunk}.
