# Controls Engineering in the FIRST Robotics Competition
## Graduate-level control theory for high schoolers

When I was a high school student on FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team 3512,
I had to learn control theory from scattered internet sources that either
weren't rigorous enough or assumed too much prior knowledge. After I took
graduate-level control theory courses from University of California, Santa Cruz
for my bachelor's degree, I realized that the concepts weren't difficult when
presented well, but the information wasn't broadly accessible outside academia.

I wanted to fix the information disparity so more people could appreciate the
beauty and elegance I saw in control theory. This book streamlines the learning
process to make that possible.

I wrote the initial draft of this book as a final project for an undergraduate
technical writing class I took at UCSC in Spring 2017
([CMPE 185](https://cmpe185-spring17-01.courses.soe.ucsc.edu/)). It was a
13-page IEEE-formatted paper intended as a reference manual and guide to
state-space control that summarized the three graduate controls classes I had
taken that year. I kept working on it the following year to flesh it out, and it
eventually became long enough to make into a proper book. I've been adding to it
ever since as I learn new things.

I contextualized the material within FRC because it's always been a significant
part of my life, and it's a useful application sandbox. I've since contributed
implementations of many of this book's tools to the FRC standard library
([WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib)) and maintain them.

This book should be printed on
[A5](https://www.prepressure.com/library/paper-size/din-a5) paper. Use the
printer version of the PDF
[here](https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc-printer.pdf)
instead of the one linked above because the latter is compressed for electronic
viewing.

## Running the examples

Example Python scripts can be obtained from frccontrol's Git repository at
https://github.com/calcmogul/frccontrol/tree/main/examples. Furthermore, all
scripts in the [code](code) directory are runnable by the user. They require
Python 3.5+ and frccontrol. frccontrol can be installed with the following
command.

```
pip3 install --user frccontrol
```

Some also use bookutil, a Python package containing common utilities for this
book. That can be installed by running `pip3 install --user -e bookutil` from
the root of this Git repository.

The scripts can be run as follows:

```
./elevator.py
```

Some Linux platforms use tk as a backend for matplotlib, so that may need to be
installed to see the plots.

have to be installed manually. Modifications to the Python package folders in
`build` will be reflected in any scripts which use the venv.

### Style guide

All LaTeX labels, including bibliography entries, should use underscores to
represent spaces between words instead of hyphens. Hyphens should only be used
where the character being written is already a hyphen. `.tex` file names should
use hyphens and `.py` file names should use underscores.

When including linebreaks in equations, insert the linebreak and a `\qquad`
before the next operator.

Glossary entries in [glossary-entries.tex](glossary-entries.tex) should be
lexographically sorted by entry key. The entry key should be the same as the
name. The words in the name should be lowercase, and the description should
start with a capital letter and end with a period. The first sentence should be
a fragment, but sentences after that, if applicable, should be complete.

Bibliography entries in
[controls-engineering-in-frc.bib](controls-engineering-in-frc.bib) should be
sorted lexographically by label. Links to online videos should use the `@misc`
tag. Links to online static resources like PDFs should use the `@online` tag.

Book content should answer the question _why_ something works the way it does
and how and when to use it to solve problems.
